      <div class="content">
        I spent most of today moving around my e-mail infrastructure. The way I had it configured would probably bring tears to most people&rsquo;s eyes, so I&rsquo;ll spare you the gruesome details. Let&rsquo;s just say that nothing is forwarding to Google Mail any longer and I&rsquo;ll be using a different address as my main contact address from here on out. Namely me@kilian.io. The domain kilian.io has been pointing to my server at Uberspace for a little while now, but it hasn&rsquo;t been much more than a little gimmick, just like kilian.

      <div class="content">
        There&rsquo;s been a bug with current versions of Jetbrains products (not just Pycharm, but also IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, AppCode and surely the others as well) on OS X 10.10 Yosemite where the editor screen flickers uncontrollably when you scroll the view. It&rsquo;s been making my workflow increasingly difficult and was generally unpleasing, but there is a way around this!
Kudos goes to Justus for pointing this one out.
All you have to do is set your favorite Jetbrains IDE to use the JVM version 1.

        It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve touched Blender. A lot has changed, everything is awesome. There&rsquo;s not all too much to say, but I&rsquo;m a real sucker for pretty clay renders, so here&rsquo;s a simple little robot.
Note that this render is in 2400p, the native resolution of the new MacBook Pro. I didn&rsquo;t want said device to go up in flames though, so a shoutout goes to render.st (and especially their signup bonus).

      <div class="content">
        I have to admit to having been slightly jealous of a friend running Arch Linux on his laptop when he went ahead and installed xmind right through his package manager (or actually yaourt, but I won&rsquo;t make the distinction here). Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with installing applications on OS X. It&rsquo;s dead simple.
You download the disk image, double-click it to mount and drag the .app onto your linked Applications directory.

      <div class="content">
        November 29th, 2012: Left a math lecture on a rainy day and wanted to get home as quick as possible. But it looked like I would be carrying my bike home seeing how some douche had stolen my front wheel on campus. Seeing how I moved to Dresden with quick release skewers (if I can trust dict.leo.org) however, this happening was just a matter of time. Instead of directly buying a new wheel (and new brakes, thank you, asshole!

      <div class="content">
        Optimizing every single aspect of my digital live is something I&rsquo;ve been enjoying for years. It&rsquo;s the little things, being able to define a new shortcut for a task that I do all day, streamlining a complex process that has had me looking up howtos everytime I had to do it, but the same has never really held true for my life away from the keyboard. I&rsquo;m definitely not what you would call messy, but the organization of my desk, room or now my apartment has never been one of my strengths.

        (Making the Arrested Development reference in the title there was damn tempting, but nope, didn&rsquo;t go for it.)I&rsquo;m not a huge blogger, I know that. I&rsquo;ve been installing and running away from I guess around 10 to 20 blogs in the last few years (I can at least find one of the remnants to still be online, probably due to the fact that this is the only instance I didn&rsquo;t host myself) and have had a lot more fun playing around with the software itself than writing, although I always aim to change that.

      <div class="content">
        In great contrast to Alfred being one of those apps I love more than anything on OS X, the caps lock key is something utterly useless nowadays (or ever for that matter). And if you do happen to find yourself in an argument on the internet, even Homer Simpson agrees that you put a lot more weight into your statement if you take your time to press the shift key. The already mentioned Alfred however is so immensely useful, that even two keys for its hotkey (the default alt + space) is too much.

      <div class="content">
        I remember being severely dissapointed about two years ago when I wanted to download the free students version of Maya, the so called PLE (Personal Learning Edition), but since Maya had already been acquired by Autodesk (before: Alias), this was no longer offered. I also wasn’t able to find any mirrors for that online, but today that PLE would be a far outdated version, so it wouldn’t be that useful anyways.

        That was seriously awesome! My first congress and I couldn’t be happier with it. Definitely coming back next year, for sure!
There’s so much I could write about here, but I’m going to keep it to a minimum. I kinda regret watching quite a few talks live and not using the time at CCH to have a look at most assemblies and workshops. Will improve on that @ 33c3. All talks have since been published online at https://media.

      <div class="content">
        A friend recently had the fun idea to write a small script for his machine running Arch displaying his current battery state as a series of hearts instead of the traditional boring percentage. He did so via a short python script and the magic of Font Awesome to integrate with Conky.
I have to admit that writing a quick script in your language of choice makes customization like this a lot easier than on OS X, but I liked the idea and wanted to follow along with something native as well.

      <div class="content">
        Update: I changed the post title from Why I won&rsquo;t be keeping my Apple Watch to the current one. Let me explain why.
My biggest gripe with the watch was the in my opinion abysmal battery performance of my iPhone when connected to the watch. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what changed, but I believe the watch is actually affecting how I use my phone during the day. Specifically how often I do so.

        A few months ago Code for Germany launched. An OK Lab (Open Knowledge Lab) was founded in Dresden soon after, although similar projects (offenesdresden.de) were already in place. Everything merged and Dresden has had quite an active community interested in bringing Open Data to the next level. It&rsquo;s awesome.
My first real contribution to this comes in form of an iPhone app using a PHP scraper backend scraping the data at dresden.

        I spent most of today moving around my e-mail infrastructure. The way I had it configured would probably bring tears to most people&rsquo;s eyes, so I&rsquo;ll spare you the gruesome details. Let&rsquo;s just say that nothing is forwarding to Google Mail any longer and I&rsquo;ll be using a different address as my main contact address from here on out. Namely me@kilian.io. The domain kilian.io has been pointing to my server at Uberspace for a little while now, but it hasn&rsquo;t been much more than a little gimmick, just like kilian.

      <div class="content">
        There&rsquo;s been a bug with current versions of Jetbrains products (not just Pycharm, but also IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, AppCode and surely the others as well) on OS X 10.10 Yosemite where the editor screen flickers uncontrollably when you scroll the view. It&rsquo;s been making my workflow increasingly difficult and was generally unpleasing, but there is a way around this!
Kudos goes to Justus for pointing this one out.
All you have to do is set your favorite Jetbrains IDE to use the JVM version 1.

        It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve touched Blender. A lot has changed, everything is awesome. There&rsquo;s not all too much to say, but I&rsquo;m a real sucker for pretty clay renders, so here&rsquo;s a simple little robot.
Note that this render is in 2400p, the native resolution of the new MacBook Pro. I didn&rsquo;t want said device to go up in flames though, so a shoutout goes to render.st (and especially their signup bonus).

        I have to admit to having been slightly jealous of a friend running Arch Linux on his laptop when he went ahead and installed xmind right through his package manager (or actually yaourt, but I won&rsquo;t make the distinction here). Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with installing applications on OS X. It&rsquo;s dead simple. You download the disk image, double-click it to mount and drag the .

        November 29th, 2012: Left a math lecture on a rainy day and wanted to get home as quick as possible. But it looked like I would be carrying my bike home seeing how some douche had stolen my front wheel on campus. Seeing how I moved to Dresden with quick release skewers (if I can trust dict.leo.org) however, this happening was just a matter of time. Instead of directly buying a new wheel (and new brakes, thank you, asshole!

      <div class="content">
        Optimizing every single aspect of my digital live is something I&rsquo;ve been enjoying for years. It&rsquo;s the little things, being able to define a new shortcut for a task that I do all day, streamlining a complex process that has had me looking up howtos everytime I had to do it, but the same has never really held true for my life away from the keyboard. I&rsquo;m definitely not what you would call messy, but the organization of my desk, room or now my apartment has never been one of my strengths.

        Apple was gracious enough to grant me a WWDC scholarship this year. I‚Äôm still blown away! The next challenge is obviously getting to SF. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not exactly cheap traveling all the way from Germany, but I‚Äôll find a way. Definitely couldn‚Äôt justify missing this one-of-a-kind event.
Stay posted for more, especially once it‚Äôs June üòÅ

      <div class="content">
        Until recently I had the pleasure of living with a static IP. This made accessing my Raspberry PI from outside my home rather easy. I could just open the port on my router and hardcode the IP anywhere.
After moving though easy access like that unfortunately fell away. I looked into some services like DynDNS but found them cumbersome and hard to work with. A simple solution to this ‚Äúproblem‚Äù presented itself via CloudFlare.

        Finished it two days ago and was left in some emotional turmoil. I believed the ending to be spoiled for me after accidentally having read a sentence on Reddit, but it turns out that was bullshit. Unfortunately that made it even worse.
It‚Äôs a gorgeous game, albeit relatively short (~4 hours). The gameplay mechanics work great (a bit unexpected at times) and the story is definitely captivating. Can‚Äôt say too much about it though without giving stuff away.

        Blindly following a recommendation on Reddit I just finished watching the first season of Black Mirror. Not quite sure what I was expecting, only had the SciFi label in my head. Didn‚Äôt quite find that, more of a feeling of deep disgust with the different shown realities. Interesting nonetheless. And definitely a recommendation!

        That was seriously awesome! My first congress and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with it. Definitely coming back next year, for sure!
There‚Äôs so much I could write about here, but I‚Äôm going to keep it to a minimum. I kinda regret watching quite a few talks live and not using the time at CCH to have a look at most assemblies and workshops. Will improve on that @ 33c3. All talks have since been published online at https://media.

      <div class="content">
        A friend recently had the fun idea to write a small script for his machine running Arch displaying his current battery state as a series of hearts instead of the traditional boring percentage. He did so via a short python script and the magic of Font Awesome to integrate with Conky.
I have to admit that writing a quick script in your language of choice makes customization like this a lot easier than on OS X, but I liked the idea and wanted to follow along with something native as well.

      <div class="content">
        Update: I changed the post title from Why I won&rsquo;t be keeping my Apple Watch to the current one. Let me explain why.
My biggest gripe with the watch was the in my opinion abysmal battery performance of my iPhone when connected to the watch. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what changed, but I believe the watch is actually affecting how I use my phone during the day. Specifically how often I do so.

        A few months ago Code for Germany launched. An OK Lab (Open Knowledge Lab) was founded in Dresden soon after, although similar projects (offenesdresden.de) were already in place. Everything merged and Dresden has had quite an active community interested in bringing Open Data to the next level. It&rsquo;s awesome.
My first real contribution to this comes in form of an iPhone app using a PHP scraper backend scraping the data at dresden.

        I spent most of today moving around my e-mail infrastructure. The way I had it configured would probably bring tears to most people&rsquo;s eyes, so I&rsquo;ll spare you the gruesome details. Let&rsquo;s just say that nothing is forwarding to Google Mail any longer and I&rsquo;ll be using a different address as my main contact address from here on out. Namely me@kilian.io. The domain kilian.io has been pointing to my server at Uberspace for a little while now, but it hasn&rsquo;t been much more than a little gimmick, just like kilian.

      <div class="content">
        There&rsquo;s been a bug with current versions of Jetbrains products (not just Pycharm, but also IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, AppCode and surely the others as well) on OS X 10.10 Yosemite where the editor screen flickers uncontrollably when you scroll the view. It&rsquo;s been making my workflow increasingly difficult and was generally unpleasing, but there is a way around this!
Kudos goes to Justus for pointing this one out.
All you have to do is set your favorite Jetbrains IDE to use the JVM version 1.

      <div class="content">
        I recently wrote a small Vapor web app in Swift which I then wanted to deploy on my server inside a docker container. Not having all too much experience with docker my simple Dockerfile looked something like this.
FROM swift:4 COPY . . EXPOSE 8080 RUN swift build --configuration release ENTRYPOINT [&quot;.build/release/Run&quot;] CMD [&quot;serve&quot;, &quot;--env=production&quot;]  Whilst this worked perfectly fine, the image size turned out to be a whopping 1.

        As promised in my last post I wanted to write a post about a talk I recently held at Mobile Camp 2017. I also held the talk again at our local Cocoaheads Meetup on May 24th 2017, this time being recorded on video (Thanks, Ben!). But since the talk is in German, I promised to publish an English summary here as well, so here we go 😊
The slides are online as well and can be found on GitHub Pages.

      <div class="content">
        Update (2017-09-23): Apple recently removed the App Store entirely from iTunes (a welcome move), which kinda broke the entire workflow here. It is however still possible to download IPA files to your Mac through the use of Apple Configurator 2.
 Buy and download the app via your iOS device Open Apple Configurator and login under &ldquo;Account&rdquo; Connect your device, then go to &ldquo;Add&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Application&rdquo; and choose the app in question from your purchase history A dialog will open asking you if you want to overwrite the app or continue in another fashion.

      <div class="content">
        People love images [citation needed]. Or at least I know I do. And I&rsquo;ve previously stated elsewhere that I hate downloading or installing software that doesn&rsquo;t show me any obvious references to its visuals beforehand. I mean come on, it&rsquo;s just a screenshot, how hard can it be? GIFs or videos get bonus ✨ points. This obviously also goes for CLIs, which doesn&rsquo;t mean you should skimp on man pages and/or good --help documentation, but a link to a &ldquo;video&rdquo; powered by asciinema speaks volumes compared to a textual description of usage patterns!

        I&rsquo;m a podcast addict. I have been for a few years now and I can&rsquo;t seem to stop. Podcastprofile has a not very current list of all the feeds I&rsquo;m subscribed to.
With all the content I consume it only seems logical to produce something at some point as well, or at least try. Hendrik and me have had that plan for quite a while if I recall correctly, and two months ago we finally decided to do something about it.

      <div class="content">
        Those of us who use Xcode to build, run and deploy projects of ours have probably run into an issue where we&rsquo;ve forgotten to increment the build number before trying to deploy a project. In my case the problem is usually iTunes Connect, which doesn&rsquo;t take your app&rsquo;s version (or CFBundleShortVersionString) into account, but only the build number (or CFBundleVersion). The former is the version we usually set (according to semver if you&rsquo;re a good person, although it really doesn&rsquo;t make much of a difference for user-facing versions) to identify the version internally.

      <div class="content">
        A friend of mine has recently started automating some of his tasks using Alfred workflows, a feature of Alfred I&rsquo;ve been using for years, but have never really thought about using for my own stuff before.
Although they can sometimes come across rather gimicky, Alfred workflows are actually quite powerful. There&rsquo;s a huge amount of possibilities built right in, but in this post I really only want to focus on a short introduction to so called script filters.

        Had a fantastic time about two weeks ago at dubdubdeesee in San Francisco. First time at the West Coast and I&rsquo;m completely blown away by the amount of amazing people and great time we had. This post is going to be a quick recap of my experiences along the way.
After not expecting to receive the scholarship by Apple at all, I unfortunately did not seem to qualify for Apple&rsquo;s Travel Assistance, which meant I had to gather around ~1.

      <div class="content">
        I’ve been seriously disliking the idea of maintaining a Facebook profile for quite a while now. It adds close to nothing to my life. After having loaded the page it seems I am always being presented with the same content over and over. The newsfeed is completely and utterly useless.
A few months back I chose to delete my personal timeline. Facebook started to show me content from a few years back (from a much younger self) and I was presented with things that I really did not wish to display publicly online.

        Apple was gracious enough to grant me a WWDC scholarship this year. I’m still blown away! The next challenge is obviously getting to SF. Unfortunately it’s not exactly cheap traveling all the way from Germany, but I’ll find a way. Definitely couldn’t justify missing this one-of-a-kind event.
Stay posted for more, especially once it’s June 😁

      <div class="content">
        I recently held a talk about reverse engineering iOS apps at Mobile Camp 2017. There will be another post about said talk soon, since I&rsquo;ll be holding it again at our local Cocoaheads meetup in a few days, this time with a video recording üòä.
One of my topics was taking a look into an app&rsquo;s bundle, for which I had an app in mind that bundled an interesting SQLite database 1.

      <div class="content">
        People love images [citation needed]. Or at least I know I do. And I&rsquo;ve previously stated elsewhere that I hate downloading or installing software that doesn&rsquo;t show me any obvious references to its visuals beforehand. I mean come on, it&rsquo;s just a screenshot, how hard can it be? GIFs or videos get bonus ‚ú® points. This obviously also goes for CLIs, which doesn&rsquo;t mean you should skimp on man pages and/or good --help documentation, but a link to a &ldquo;video&rdquo; powered by asciinema speaks volumes compared to a textual description of usage patterns!

        I&rsquo;m a podcast addict. I have been for a few years now and I can&rsquo;t seem to stop. Podcastprofile has a not very current list of all the feeds I&rsquo;m subscribed to.
With all the content I consume it only seems logical to produce something at some point as well, or at least try. Hendrik and me have had that plan for quite a while if I recall correctly, and two months ago we finally decided to do something about it.

      <div class="content">
        Those of us who use Xcode to build, run and deploy projects of ours have probably run into an issue where we&rsquo;ve forgotten to increment the build number before trying to deploy a project. In my case the problem is usually iTunes Connect, which doesn&rsquo;t take your app&rsquo;s version (or CFBundleShortVersionString) into account, but only the build number (or CFBundleVersion). The former is the version we usually set (according to semver if you&rsquo;re a good person, although it really doesn&rsquo;t make much of a difference for user-facing versions) to identify the version internally.

      <div class="content">
        A friend of mine has recently started automating some of his tasks using Alfred workflows, a feature of Alfred I&rsquo;ve been using for years, but have never really thought about using for my own stuff before.
Although they can sometimes come across rather gimicky, Alfred workflows are actually quite powerful. There&rsquo;s a huge amount of possibilities built right in, but in this post I really only want to focus on a short introduction to so called script filters.

        Had a fantastic time about two weeks ago at dubdubdeesee in San Francisco. First time at the West Coast and I&rsquo;m completely blown away by the amount of amazing people and great time we had. This post is going to be a quick recap of my experiences along the way.
After not expecting to receive the scholarship by Apple at all, I unfortunately did not seem to qualify for Apple&rsquo;s Travel Assistance, which meant I had to gather around ~1.

      <div class="content">
        I‚Äôve been seriously disliking the idea of maintaining a Facebook profile for quite a while now. It adds close to nothing to my life. After having loaded the page it seems I am always being presented with the same content over and over. The newsfeed is completely and utterly useless.
A few months back I chose to delete my personal timeline. Facebook started to show me content from a few years back (from a much younger self) and I was presented with things that I really did not wish to display publicly online.

        Apple was gracious enough to grant me a WWDC scholarship this year. I‚Äôm still blown away! The next challenge is obviously getting to SF. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not exactly cheap traveling all the way from Germany, but I‚Äôll find a way. Definitely couldn‚Äôt justify missing this one-of-a-kind event.
Stay posted for more, especially once it‚Äôs June üòÅ

      <div class="content">
        Until recently I had the pleasure of living with a static IP. This made accessing my Raspberry PI from outside my home rather easy. I could just open the port on my router and hardcode the IP anywhere.
After moving though easy access like that unfortunately fell away. I looked into some services like DynDNS but found them cumbersome and hard to work with. A simple solution to this ‚Äúproblem‚Äù presented itself via CloudFlare.

        Finished it two days ago and was left in some emotional turmoil. I believed the ending to be spoiled for me after accidentally having read a sentence on Reddit, but it turns out that was bullshit. Unfortunately that made it even worse.
It‚Äôs a gorgeous game, albeit relatively short (~4 hours). The gameplay mechanics work great (a bit unexpected at times) and the story is definitely captivating. Can‚Äôt say too much about it though without giving stuff away.

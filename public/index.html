      <div class="content">
        A friend of mine has recently started automating some of his tasks using Alfred workflows, a feature of Alfred I&rsquo;ve been using for years, but have never really thought about using for my own stuff before.
Although they can sometimes come across rather gimicky, Alfred workflows are actually quite powerful. There&rsquo;s a huge amount of possibilities built right in, but in this post I really only want to focus on a short introduction to so called script filters.

        Had a fantastic time about two weeks ago at dubdubdeesee in San Francisco. First time at the West Coast and I&rsquo;m completely blown away by the amount of amazing people and great time we had. This post is going to be a quick recap of my experiences along the way.
After not expecting to receive the scholarship by Apple at all, I unfortunately did not seem to qualify for Apple&rsquo;s Travel Assistance, which meant I had to gather around ~1.

      <div class="content">
        I‚Äôve been seriously disliking the idea of maintaining a Facebook profile for quite a while now. It adds close to nothing to my life. After having loaded the page it seems I am always being presented with the same content over and over. The newsfeed is completely and utterly useless.
A few months back I chose to delete my personal timeline. Facebook started to show me content from a few years back (from a much younger self) and I was presented with things that I really did not wish to display publicly online.

        Apple was gracious enough to grant me a WWDC scholarship this year. I‚Äôm still blown away! The next challenge is obviously getting to SF. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not exactly cheap traveling all the way from Germany, but I‚Äôll find a way. Definitely couldn‚Äôt justify missing this one-of-a-kind event.
Stay posted for more, especially once it‚Äôs June üòÅ

      <div class="content">
        Until recently I had the pleasure of living with a static IP. This made accessing my Raspberry PI from outside my home rather easy. I could just open the port on my router and hardcode the IP anywhere.
After moving though easy access like that unfortunately fell away. I looked into some services like DynDNS but found them cumbersome and hard to work with. A simple solution to this ‚Äúproblem‚Äù presented itself via CloudFlare.

        Finished it two days ago and was left in some emotional turmoil. I believed the ending to be spoiled for me after accidentally having read a sentence on Reddit, but it turns out that was bullshit. Unfortunately that made it even worse.
It‚Äôs a gorgeous game, albeit relatively short (~4 hours). The gameplay mechanics work great (a bit unexpected at times) and the story is definitely captivating. Can‚Äôt say too much about it though without giving stuff away.

        Blindly following a recommendation on Reddit I just finished watching the first season of Black Mirror. Not quite sure what I was expecting, only had the SciFi label in my head. Didn‚Äôt quite find that, more of a feeling of deep disgust with the different shown realities. Interesting nonetheless. And definitely a recommendation!

        That was seriously awesome! My first congress and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with it. Definitely coming back next year, for sure!
There‚Äôs so much I could write about here, but I‚Äôm going to keep it to a minimum. I kinda regret watching quite a few talks live and not using the time at CCH to have a look at most assemblies and workshops. Will improve on that @ 33c3. All talks have since been published online at https://media.

      <div class="content">
        A friend recently had the fun idea to write a small script for his machine running Arch displaying his current battery state as a series of hearts instead of the traditional boring percentage. He did so via a short python script and the magic of Font Awesome to integrate with Conky.
I have to admit that writing a quick script in your language of choice makes customization like this a lot easier than on OS X, but I liked the idea and wanted to follow along with something native as well.

      <div class="content">
        Update: I changed the post title from Why I won&rsquo;t be keeping my Apple Watch to the current one. Let me explain why.
My biggest gripe with the watch was the in my opinion abysmal battery performance of my iPhone when connected to the watch. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what changed, but I believe the watch is actually affecting how I use my phone during the day. Specifically how often I do so.

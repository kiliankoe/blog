    <div class="content">
      <p>I spent most of today moving around my e-mail <em>infrastructure</em>. The way I had it configured would probably bring tears to most people&rsquo;s eyes, so I&rsquo;ll spare you the gruesome details. Let&rsquo;s just say that nothing is forwarding to Google Mail any longer and I&rsquo;ll be using a different address as my main contact address from here on out. Namely <strong>me@kilian.io</strong>. The domain kilian.io has been pointing to my server at <a href="https://uberspace.de">Uberspace</a> for a little while now, but it hasn&rsquo;t been much more than a little gimmick, just like <a href="http://kilian.sexy">kilian.sexy</a> ;)
I&rsquo;ve been starting to enjoy it a lot more than koeltzs.ch though, as it carries more personality, more <em>me</em> than just my last name. And since kilian@kilian.io just looks ridiculous I&rsquo;m choosing to go with the very informal me@kilian.io instead.</p>

<p>The <em>old</em> domain koeltzs.ch isn&rsquo;t going anywhere any time soon. I&rsquo;ll probably be renewing it as well for the years to come, mails and redirects will still work. Transitioning basically my life&rsquo;s worth of emails is no easy task either, but consider my Google Mail address officially deprecated from here on out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also used this chance to deactivate the catchall for all my domains. Mail bounces aren&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing and this should also greatly help reduce the amount of spam that hits my mailserver day and night.</p>

<p>My PGP key has also been updated with the new address and I&rsquo;ll soon be transitioning to me@kilian.io for some of my xmpp/jabber conversations as well. Even though my site already states this, that particular change will still take a bit.</p>

<p>I really do have to endorse <a href="https://fastmail.com">Fastmail.com</a> somewhere throughout this post. Hosting my own mail server is something I definitely <strong>do not</strong> want to do be doing.  I have a tendency not to trust software that I maintain myself (I know that sounds sad) and even more so when I don&rsquo;t understand it all. So even though I&rsquo;d be able to keep it running, I&rsquo;m not sure it would be doing so safely or for a very long time. I&rsquo;m trusting this one with people that make this their living. The recommendation for Fastmail comes from <a href="http://marco.org">Marco Arment</a>. They&rsquo;ve been around for a little while and are doing some <a href="http://blog.fastmail.com/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/">really cool things</a> as well, they definitely know what they&rsquo;re doing and are doing it well. And I enjoy paying for something of use to me, highlighting the fact that I&rsquo;m probably not the product here.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m definitely going to run into a few gotchas with this move, I&rsquo;m sure of that. But I have to be doing this someday. So <a href="http://longestjokeintheworld.com">better nate than lever</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually been a lot of fun and the only thing to change now is the domain for this blog. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t run this under two domains simultaneously, so I&rsquo;m going to be making this switch Monday evening (as in today, depending on how current this is when you read it). So if you&rsquo;re one of the few people I know to be subscribed to the feed, please update it to check blog.kilian.io from now on. Thanks :)</p>

<p>Edit: Done :)</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p><sub>(Making the <em>Arrested Development</em> reference in the title there was damn tempting, but nope, didn&rsquo;t go for it.)</sub></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a huge blogger, I know that. I&rsquo;ve been installing and running away from I guess around 10 to 20 blogs in the last few years (I can at least find <a href="http://completelyfocused.wordpress.com">one</a> of the remnants to still be online, probably due to the fact that this is the only instance I didn&rsquo;t host myself) and have had a lot more fun playing around with the software itself than writing, although I always aim to change that.
I guess I could write a few sentences about why I think this time might be different, but I&rsquo;ve written those over and over again as well. But what I do know is that at least the software is different this time. It&rsquo;s not just another Wordpress installation, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a few things pushing me towards using Ghost as a blogging platform. It has to be something free and open, something I could host myself, something without a lot of bullshit that comes with it (sorry Wordpress and every other CMS out there), something that supports markdown, something that is managed over a browser (sorry Octopress<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>), something that doesn&rsquo;t push me towards writing novels for everything (sorry Medium (yeah I know, not really a blog&hellip; (and yes, nested parentheses!))), something that is still customizeable (sorry, Svtble) and as an added bonus, something that&rsquo;s built on top of Node.js.</p>

<p>Ghost is a perfect fit. The minimality (if that is a word) of it just makes me happy on a level that I can&rsquo;t yet really appreciate fully. But I will, I&rsquo;m sure of that. The one thing I&rsquo;m not entirely sure about yet however is if I&rsquo;m going to be hosting it on ghost.org or myself. Here it&rsquo;s stable and will be kept updated even if I forget, but it costs money. Well, it&rsquo;s going to cost me money in every case, I&rsquo;ll just run through the 30 day trial and make up an opinion on the go I guess.</p>

<p>So much for now, here goes nothing!</p>

<p>P.S. One downside are the missing comments. But everything is open source, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be much of an issue forking the default theme on Github and adding Disqus. I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind for the future.</p>

<li id="fn:1">My main computer just died and while it&rsquo;s in the Apple Store being fixed for a ridiculous amount of money, pushing new content to my Octopress running inside a Github repo is more of a hassle than anything else. Getting my SSH key out of my backup for starters and then installing Ruby/rake? No thanks.

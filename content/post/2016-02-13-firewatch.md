Finished it two days ago and was left in some emotional turmoil. I believed the ending to be spoiled for me after accidentally having read a sentence on Reddit, but it turns out that was bullshit. Unfortunately that made it even worse.

Itâ€™s a gorgeous game, albeit relatively short (~4 hours). The gameplay mechanics work great (a bit unexpected at times) and the story is definitely captivating. Canâ€™t say too much about it though without giving stuff away.
Definitely recommended! Itâ€™s **not** a horror game either, just thrilling at times and beautiful at others. Give it a shot! ðŸ˜Š

Itâ€™s available for Mac, Windows and PS4. Grab it on Steam [here](http://store.steampowered.com/app/383870/).

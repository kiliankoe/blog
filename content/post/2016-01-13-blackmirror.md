Blindly following a recommendation on Reddit I just finished watching the first season of [Black Mirror](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059). Not quite sure what I was expecting, only had the SciFi label in my head. Didnâ€™t quite find that, more of a feeling of deep disgust with the different shown realities. Interesting nonetheless. And definitely a recommendation!

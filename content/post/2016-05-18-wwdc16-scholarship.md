Apple was gracious enough to grant me a WWDC scholarship this year. I’m still blown away!

The next challenge is obviously getting to SF. Unfortunately it’s not exactly cheap traveling all the way from Germany, but I’ll find a way. Definitely couldn’t justify missing this one-of-a-kind event.

Stay posted for more, especially once it’s June 😁

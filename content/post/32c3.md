That was seriously awesome! My first congress and I couldnâ€™t be happier with it. Definitely coming back next year, for sure!

Thereâ€™s so much I could write about here, but Iâ€™m going to keep it to a minimum.
I kinda regret watching quite a few talks live and not using the time at CCH to have a look at most assemblies and workshops. Will improve on that @ 33c3. All talks have since been published online at [https://media.ccc.de](media.ccc.de). Have a look, and come next year! ðŸ˜Š
